Hibernian was founded in 1875 by Irish immigrants, but support for the club is now based on geography rather than ethnicity or religion. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge.\r\n\r\nThe name of the club is usually shortened to Hibs. The team are also called The Hibees (pronounced /ˈhaɪbiːz/) and The Cabbage, a shortening of the rhyming slang for Hibs of \"Cabbage and Ribs\", by fans of the club, who are themselves also known as Hibbies. Home matches are played at the Easter Road stadium, in use since 1893, when the club joined the Scottish Football League. Hibernian have played in the second tier of the Scottish football league system, known as the Scottish Championship, since being relegated in 2014.\r\n\r\nHibernian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1952. Three of those four championships were won between 1948 and 1952, when the club had the services of The Famous Five, a notable forward line. The club have won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1887 and 1902; but have lost ten Scottish Cup Finals since, most recently in 2013. The last major trophy won by the club was the 2006–07 Scottish League Cup, when Kilmarnock were beaten 5–1 in the final. This was the third time Hibs had won the League Cup, also winning in 1972–73 and 1991–92.\r\nThe team reached the League Cup final, (2015–16) which was lost to Ross County. This was followed by victory in the Scottish Cup for the first time since 1902, culminating in a cup final win against Rangers. Soon after the cup win Stubbs left Hibs to manage Rotherham United. He was replaced by Neil Lennon, who led the team to promotion by winning the 2016–17 Scottish Championship.","Logo":"89504E470D0A1A0A0000000D49484452...

It is one of two Scottish Professional Football League clubs in the city, the other being their Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Hibernian was founded in 1875 by Irish immigrants, but support for the club is now based on geography rather than ethnicity or religion. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge.\r\n\r\nThe name of the club is usually shortened to Hibs. The team are also called The Hibees (pronounced /ˈhaɪbiːz/) and The Cabbage, a shortening of the rhyming slang for Hibs of \"Cabbage and Ribs\", by fans of the club, who are themselves also known as Hibbies. Home matches are played at the Easter Road stadium, in use since 1893, when the club joined the Scottish Football League. Hibernian have played in the second tier of the Scottish football league system, known as the Scottish Championship, since being relegated in 2014.\r\n\r\nHibernian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1952. Three of those four championships were won between 1948 and 1952, when the club had the services of The Famous Five, a notable forward line. The club have won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1887 and 1902; but have lost ten Scottish Cup Finals since, most recently in 2013. The last major trophy won by the club was the 2006–07 Scottish League Cup, when Kilmarnock were beaten 5–1 in the final. This was the third time Hibs had won the League Cup, also winning in 1972–73 and 1991–92.\r\nThe team reached the League Cup final, (2015–16) which was lost to Ross County. This was followed by victory in the Scottish Cup for the first time since 1902, culminating in a cup final win against Rangers. Soon after the cup win Stubbs left Hibs to manage Rotherham United. He was replaced by Neil Lennon, who led the team to promotion by winning the 2016–17 Scottish Championship.","Logo":"89504E470D0A1A0A0000000D49484452...

They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year, and have never been relegated from the top division of the Scottish football league system.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup, both in 1983. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, but a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.\r\n\r\nAberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 21,421 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee.","Logo":"89504E470D0A1A0A0000000D49484452...

It is also commonly known by Celtic fans as either Parkhead or Paradise.\r\n\r\nCeltic was formed in November 1887 and first laid out a ground in the Parkhead area in 1888. The club moved to a different site in 1892, however, when the rental charge was greatly increased. The new site was developed into an oval shaped stadium, with vast terracing sections. The record attendance of 83,500 was set by an Old Firm derby on 1 January 1938. The terraces were covered and floodlights were installed between 1957 and 1971. The Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs should have an all-seated stadium by August 1994. Celtic was in a bad financial position in the early 1990s and no major work was carried out until Fergus McCann took control of the club in March 1994. He carried out a plan to demolish the old terraces and develop a new stadium in a phased rebuild, which was completed in August 1998.\r\n\r\nCeltic Park has often been used as a venue for Scotland internationals and Cup Finals, particularly when Hampden Park has been unavailable. Before the First World War, Celtic Park hosted various other sporting events, including composite rules shinty-hurling, track and field and the 1897 Track Cycling World Championships.

The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge.\r\n\r\nThe name of the club is usually shortened to Hibs. The team are also called The Hibees (pronounced /ˈhaɪbiːz/) and The Cabbage, a shortening of the rhyming slang for Hibs of \"Cabbage and Ribs\", by fans of the club, who are themselves also known as Hibbies. Home matches are played at the Easter Road stadium, in use since 1893, when the club joined the Scottish Football League. Hibernian have played in the second tier of the Scottish football league system, known as the Scottish Championship, since being relegated in 2014.\r\n\r\nHibernian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1952. Three of those four championships were won between 1948 and 1952, when the club had the services of The Famous Five, a notable forward line. The club have won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1887 and 1902; but have lost ten Scottish Cup Finals since, most recently in 2013.

Easter Road is also known by Hibs fans as \"The Holy Ground\" or \"The Leith San Siro\". The venue has also been used to stage international matches, Scottish League Cup semi-finals and was briefly the home ground of the Edinburgh professional rugby union team.\r\n\r\nHibs first played at the present site of Easter Road in 1893. The record attendance of 65,860, when the stadium had vast terracing sections, was set by an Edinburgh derby on 2 January 1950. The size of the terracing was greatly reduced in the 1980s. After the publication of the Taylor Report, Hibs considered leaving Easter Road and moving to a different site (Straiton, near Loanhead was mooted), but these plans were abandoned in 1994. Redevelopment of the stadium began in 1995 and was completed in 2010. The Easter Road pitch had a pronounced slope until it was removed at the end of the 1999–2000 season.","Location":"Leith, Edinburgh","$type":"Stadium"},"ExternalId":"133646","Id":"00ee8061-35f1-4597-89c5-544443182c04","$type":"CreateTeamCommand"},"Module":"Phrases","Context":"Command:00ee8061-35f1-4597-89c5-544443182c04"}
